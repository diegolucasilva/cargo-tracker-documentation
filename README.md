# Introduction

The Cargo Tracker project demonstrates how you can develop applications with the Java EE platform using widely adopted architectural best practices like Domain-Driven Design \(DDD\). The project is directly based on the well known original [Java DDD sample](http://dddsample.sourceforge.net/) application developed by DDD pioneer Eric Evans' company [Domain Language](http://domainlanguage.com/) and the Swedish software consulting company [Citerus](http://www.citerus.se/). The cargo example actually comes from Eric Evans' [seminal book](http://www.amazon.com/Domain-Driven-Design-Tackling-Complexity-Software/dp/0321125215). That project uses older versions of Spring, Hibernate and Jetty whereas we focus on vanilla Java EE.
