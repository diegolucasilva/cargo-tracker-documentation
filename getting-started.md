# Getting Started

## Screen Cast

Before exploring the code, it may be helpful to view a demo of the application functionality. You can do that through a [screen cast](http://git.delabassee.com/ct/demo.html) that covers most of the major functionality for Cargo Tracker.

## Exploring the Code

## Running the Application

The project is Maven based, so you should be able to easily build it or set it up in your favorite IDE. We currently have instructions for NetBeans.

You can also run the application directly from the Maven command line using Apache Cargo. All you need to is navigate to the project source root and type:

`mvn package cargo:run`

Once the application starts up, just open up a browser and navigate to [http://localhost:8080/cargo-tracker/](http://localhost:8080/cargo-tracker/).
