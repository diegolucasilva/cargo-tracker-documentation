[Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-driven_design) does a surprisingly good job at overviewing DDD. Aslam Khan's [DDD Ref Card](http://refcardz.dzone.com/refcardz/getting-started-domain-driven) on DZone is a brief read and does a great job of explaining the core concepts of DDD. For a bit more detail, you could read the [free DDD eBook](http://www.infoq.com/minibooks/domain-driven-design-quickly) on InfoQ. Finally, you can of course read [Eric Evans' book](http://www.amazon.com/Domain-Driven-Design-Tackling-Complexity-Software/dp/0321125215) itself. However, we recommend not starting with the book until you get a bit of your bearings around this application first.
